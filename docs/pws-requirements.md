## Scope and Objectives

### PWS-001 — Current-State Summary
| | |
|---|---|
| **Requirement** | Does the PWS/SOO include a concise current-state summary? |
| **Severity** | 🟠 High |
| **Rationale** | Industry benefits when the document clearly summarizes the current state, what is not working, and the challenges driving the requirement. |

### PWS-002 — Known Risks and Constraints
| | |
|---|---|
| **Requirement** | Does the PWS/SOO identify known risks and constraints from market research? |
| **Severity** | 🟠 High |
| **Rationale** | When known risks are explicitly carried forward, industry can design solutions that intentionally mitigate risk rather than discovering it after award. |

### PWS-003 — Scope Definition
| | |
|---|---|
| **Requirement** | Does the PWS/SOO clearly define what is in-scope and out-of-scope? |
| **Severity** | 🔴 Critical |
| **Rationale** | Deliveries break down most often when scope boundaries are left implicit. |

### PWS-004 — Priorities and Trade-offs
| | |
|---|---|
| **Requirement** | Does the PWS/SOO state priorities and trade-offs among objectives? |
| **Severity** | 🟡 Medium |
| **Rationale** | When priorities are not stated, industry assumes all objectives carry equal weight, leading to inefficiencies and unnecessary costs. |

### PWS-005 — Outcomes vs Activities
| | |
|---|---|
| **Requirement** | Does the PWS/SOO emphasize outcomes rather than activities? |
| **Severity** | 🟠 High |
| **Rationale** | Scope and objectives that emphasize activities rather than outcomes create ambiguity about Government intent. |

## Technical Requirements

### PWS-006 — Technical Environment
| | |
|---|---|
| **Requirement** | Does the PWS/SOO describe the current technical environment (existing systems, tools, data sources, integrations)? |
| **Severity** | 🟠 High |
| **Rationale** | Industry needs visibility into the current environment to understand what is realistically achievable. |

### PWS-007 — Technical Debt
| | |
|---|---|
| **Requirement** | Does the PWS/SOO acknowledge existing technical debt, data quality issues, or integration constraints? |
| **Severity** | 🟡 Medium |
| **Rationale** | Known technical challenges shape what is realistically achievable and enable better solution design. |

### PWS-008 — Tool/Platform Preferences
| | |
|---|---|
| **Requirement** | Does the PWS/SOO state software, tool, platform, or methodology preferences with rationale? |
| **Severity** | 🟡 Medium |
| **Rationale** | Stating rationale (enterprise licensing, security approvals, interoperability, prior investment, workforce familiarity) helps industry align solutions appropriately. |

### PWS-009 — Contractor-Proposed Alternatives
| | |
|---|---|
| **Requirement** | Does the PWS/SOO explicitly indicate where contractor-proposed tools or methods are acceptable? |
| **Severity** | 🟡 Medium |
| **Rationale** | Explicit openness enables industry to propose higher-value and potentially lower-cost solutions rather than defaulting to legacy approaches. |

## Deliverables and Schedule

### PWS-010 — Deliverable Intent
| | |
|---|---|
| **Requirement** | Does each deliverable include the decision, action, or outcome it is meant to support? |
| **Severity** | 🟠 High |
| **Rationale** | When intent is missing, industry must treat every deliverable as mission-critical, creating unnecessary effort and complexity. |

### PWS-011 — Fixed vs Evolving Deliverables
| | |
|---|---|
| **Requirement** | Does the PWS/SOO distinguish between fixed deliverables and those expected to evolve? |
| **Severity** | 🟡 Medium |
| **Rationale** | Unclear expectations lead to over-engineered products that quickly become obsolete. |

### PWS-012 — Realistic Timelines
| | |
|---|---|
| **Requirement** | Do timelines reflect real dependencies (Government inputs, review bandwidth, decision latency)? |
| **Severity** | 🟠 High |
| **Rationale** | Timelines are harder to execute when they do not reflect real dependencies. |

### PWS-013 — Financial Deliverable Timelines
| | |
|---|---|
| **Requirement** | Do financial deliverable timelines account for contract size, teaming structures, and reconciliation time? |
| **Severity** | 🟡 Medium |
| **Rationale** | Allowing sufficient time for monthly reconciliation reduces the risk of rushed or inaccurate data. |

## Government-Furnished Resources

### PWS-014 — GFI/GFP/GFE Specification
| | |
|---|---|
| **Requirement** | Does the PWS/SOO specify what will be Government-furnished (GFI/GFP/GFE)? |
| **Severity** | 🟠 High |
| **Rationale** | Clarity on Government-furnished resources prevents onboarding delays and early performance impacts. |

### PWS-015 — Resource Availability Timing
| | |
|---|---|
| **Requirement** | Does the PWS/SOO indicate when Government-furnished resources will be available? |
| **Severity** | 🟡 Medium |
| **Rationale** | Timing clarity for CAC issuance, system access, and equipment delivery is essential for transition planning. |

### PWS-016 — Remote/Hybrid Access
| | |
|---|---|
| **Requirement** | Does the PWS/SOO address how remote/hybrid personnel will obtain access? |
| **Severity** | 🟡 Medium |
| **Rationale** | Clear guidance for hybrid or remote environments avoids early performance impacts and unnecessary friction during transition. |

## Pricing and Cost

### PWS-017 — Budget Range
| | |
|---|---|
| **Requirement** | Does the PWS/SOO include a notional budget range or anticipated scale of effort? |
| **Severity** | 🟠 High |
| **Rationale** | Budget anchors improve cost realism even when alternative approaches are proposed and reduce proposal burden. |

### PWS-018 — Variability/Surge Requirements
| | |
|---|---|
| **Requirement** | Does the PWS/SOO address anticipated variability or surge requirements? |
| **Severity** | 🟡 Medium |
| **Rationale** | Clarity on workload drivers and surge expectations enables industry to price to reality rather than uncertainty. |

### PWS-019 — Staffing and Clearance
| | |
|---|---|
| **Requirement** | Does the PWS/SOO specify staffing and clearance expectations? |
| **Severity** | 🟠 High |
| **Rationale** | Staffing and clearance expectations are key workload drivers that affect accurate pricing. |

### PWS-020 — Work Location
| | |
|---|---|
| **Requirement** | Does the PWS/SOO specify onsite vs. remote work location assumptions? |
| **Severity** | 🟡 Medium |
| **Rationale** | Location assumptions directly impact pricing and execution planning. |

### PWS-021 — System/Data Dependencies
| | |
|---|---|
| **Requirement** | Does the PWS/SOO identify dependencies on Government systems or data? |
| **Severity** | 🟡 Medium |
| **Rationale** | Dependencies affect both pricing and execution risk. |

## Performance Standards

### PWS-022 — Mission Impact Metrics
| | |
|---|---|
| **Requirement** | Do performance standards measure mission impact and decision quality (not just task completion)? |
| **Severity** | 🟠 High |
| **Rationale** | Effective performance standards focus on what the Government truly values rather than simple task completion. |

### PWS-023 — Acceptance Criteria
| | |
|---|---|
| **Requirement** | Does the PWS/SOO include clearly defined acceptance criteria? |
| **Severity** | 🟠 High |
| **Rationale** | Clear acceptance criteria help align delivery to Government expectations. |

### PWS-024 — Review Timelines/SLEs
| | |
|---|---|
| **Requirement** | Does the PWS/SOO specify review timelines and service level expectations? |
| **Severity** | 🟡 Medium |
| **Rationale** | Review timelines and SLEs help industry plan delivery cadence appropriately. |

---

## Alignment

### PWS-025 — Cross-Document Alignment
| | |
|---|---|
| **Requirement** | Are objectives, deliverables, performance standards, and evaluation criteria aligned? |
| **Severity** | 🔴 Critical |
| **Rationale** | Misalignment between requirements, evaluation criteria, and performance expectations creates execution risk. |

---

## Innovation

### PWS-026 — Flexibility Boundaries
| | |
|---|---|
| **Requirement** | Does the PWS/SOO clearly communicate where flexibility exists vs. where constraints are fixed? |
| **Severity** | 🟡 Medium |
| **Rationale** | Innovation is most effective when the Government clearly communicates the boundaries for creative solutions. |

### PWS-027 — Problem Statements
| | |
|---|---|
| **Requirement** | Does the PWS/SOO include explicit problem statements grounded in current-state challenges? |
| **Severity** | 🟠 High |
| **Rationale** | Explicit problem statements allow industry to focus innovation where it delivers the greatest mission value. |
